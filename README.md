![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https://github.com/Shurun-Wang/MFTCAN-KNR&label=visitors&countColor=%232ccce4&style=plastic)  This is the official source code repository of "Continuous Estimation of Human Joint Angles From sEMG Using a Multi-Feature Temporal Convolutional Attention-Based Network".

We provide the test data for running the model.

We provide the core algorithm and remove other contents for readability and easy to implement.

Run the main.py file.
